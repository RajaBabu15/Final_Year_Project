[Section 1: Introduction and Fundamentals of Machine Learning]

• The paper highlights the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in understanding and predicting complex multiphase flow systems.  
• It reviews the evolution of ML from early expert systems and neural network approaches to modern deep learning (DL) and physics-informed ML methods.  
• ML is categorized into supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised learning, and is showcased as an efficient tool for extracting hidden patterns from large, multidimensional data sets.  
• A key focus is on how ML bridges gaps in traditional experimental and computational methods by delivering surrogate models and data-driven insights that accelerate the design, scale-up, and control of multiphase reactors.

[Section 2: Machine Learning for Multiphase Flow Closure Modeling and Simulations]

• The review discusses the challenges of modeling multiphase flows due to their inherent multiscale, turbulent, and dynamic characteristics.  
• Traditional numerical methods such as DNS, LES, and RANS require closure models for drag, turbulence stresses, and heat/mass transfer—areas where ML offers improved accuracy and efficiency.  
• Three ML-based modeling strategies are identified:  
 – Pure data-driven models (DDM) that rely solely on training data to capture input–output relationships.  
 – Hybrid models that integrate ML with traditional physics-based models to optimize model parameters and reduce computational cost.  
 – Domain knowledge-informed models (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, PINN) that embed physical laws directly into the ML architecture, enhancing both interpretability and robustness.  
• Specific applications include ML-based drag closure modeling for gas–solid and gas–liquid flows, where neural networks have been used to predict drag forces with improved precision compared to conventional correlations.

[Section 3: ML Applications in Image Reconstruction, Regime Identification, and Process Optimization]

• The review surveys the use of ML for visualizing and reconstructing complex flow fields.  
• ML techniques facilitate regime identification in multiphase systems by classifying flow patterns from high-dimensional experimental and simulated data.  
• Key parameters of transport fields (e.g., velocity, pressure, concentration distributions) are predicted by ML models, enabling real-time monitoring and optimization of reactor performance.  
• The work emphasizes that ML not only speeds up computation but also contributes to uncertainty quantification and data fusion from various experimental and simulation sources.

[Section 4: ML in Reaction Kinetics Modeling and Reactor Performance Optimization]

• The paper extends its review to chemical reaction modeling in multiphase reactors.  
• ML is used to predict kinetic parameters, reaction networks, and species production by mining data from experiments and simulations.  
• Such models help in optimizing operating conditions and improving reactor design by providing rapid predictions and aiding in decision-making processes.  
• The authors discuss workflows for ML-enabled model discovery that integrate high-throughput experiments, descriptor selection, and cross-validation strategies to ensure robust predictions.

[Conclusions and Future Perspectives]

• The review comprehensively examines how ML methods are revolutionizing multiphase flow research—from closure modeling to process optimization.  
• Despite significant progress, challenges remain in ensuring generalizability, mitigating overfitting, and embedding sufficient domain knowledge into ML models.  
• Future research is encouraged to focus on hybrid approaches that combine physical insight with data-driven techniques, further development of physics-informed models, and creation of more extensive high-fidelity databases.  
• Overall, the paper envisions that ML and data science will continue to accelerate innovation in reactor design and the control of complex multiphase processes.
