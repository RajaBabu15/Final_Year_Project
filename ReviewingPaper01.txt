[Section 1: Introduction]

• CFD = study of flow/transport of mass, heat, and momentum  
• Three AI–CFD coupling models: data‐driven model, physical model, and hybrid model  

• The paper discusses applications of AI in CFD divided into five parts:  
 1. Optimization of aerodynamic models  
 2. Optimization of turbulence models  
 3. Simulation and prediction of complex flow fields  
 4. Modeling and verification of heat transfer  
 5. Modeling and verification of mass transfer

[Section 3: Application of AI in Aerodynamics Models]

Aim: Aircraft design and optimization  
 i. Designing the solid parts and equipment involved in aerodynamics (e.g., airfoils, turbines, blowers)  
 ii. Optimization of parameters under different Mach numbers and pressures

Traditional methods include wind-tunnel tests and CFD simulation.  
Historical optimization (1974): Hicks et al. initiated airfoil optimization.  

Two AI methods for optimizing airfoil parameters:  
 • SBO (Surrogate-Based Optimization) – builds models entirely from equations and CFD data  
 • SAO (Surrogate-Aided Optimization) – integrates partial CFD equations to tackle complex 3D problems  

Author notes: The combination of ML with traditional algorithms (e.g., GA with ANN and SVM) is key for future research.

 3.1 Aerodynamics Optimization:  
  • SBO has been widely applied when a large amount of CFD data is available. Techniques such as GA–ANN coupling replace full CFD evaluations with fast neural network predictions.  
  • In SBO, genetic algorithms optimize mesh or geometry data, and ANN establishes an input–output relationship between the optimized design and CFD results—reducing computation time dramatically.  
  • SAO uses CFD partially to calibrate surrogate models, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy when data are limited or when handling 3-D unsteady problems.  
  • Several studies (e.g., using GA–ANN and GA–MLP approaches) have demonstrated that these AI-assisted methods can achieve results comparable to traditional CFD but in a fraction of the time.

[Section 4: Application of AI in Turbulence Modeling]

• Turbulence modeling is inherently complex, and traditional methods (e.g., RANS, LES, DNS) often face challenges due to closure issues and high computation costs.  
• Two main approaches with AI:  
 – Embedding ML algorithms into existing turbulence models to optimize empirical parameters (e.g., fine-tuning the source term in Spalart-Allmaras models)  
 – Employing data-driven techniques to reconstruct hidden relationships (e.g., predicting Reynolds stress components with kernel regression or neural networks)  
• Recent studies have successfully used supervised learning (ANN, RF) to enhance turbulence model predictions.  
• These hybrid methods not only improve the accuracy of CFD predictions but also reduce uncertainties inherent in turbulence closure models.

[Section 5: Application of AI in Specific Flows]

• Specific flow problems – such as flows past a cylinder, boundary layer flows, and multiphase flows – possess unique challenges including spatiotemporal instabilities and complex interface dynamics.  
• For flows past a cylinder, auto-encoder models that incorporate physical attributes have been used to capture transient behavior and reconstruct high-dimensional flow fields from CFD and experimental data.  
• In boundary layer studies, coupling AI (e.g., DE–MLP models) with traditional methods has improved predictions of flow separation, vortex formation, and Reynolds stress distributions.  
• For multiphase flows (both without and with solid particles), AI-driven models (e.g., data-driven MLP or RBF networks) have provided accurate estimates of phase concentrations, interface dynamics, and drag coefficients, even when the underlying microphysical mechanisms remain complex.

[Section 6: Application of AI in Heat Transfer]

• Heat transfer processes are critical in energy systems, metallurgy, and chemical engineering.  
• Conventional experiments and CFD simulations are often limited by high cost and complexity when dealing with non-linear phenomena.  
• AI offers a promising alternative by:  
 – Developing physical, hybrid, and data-driven models to predict key parameters such as the heat transfer coefficient, thermal efficiency, and temperature differentials.  
 – Optimizing design parameters in systems like nanofluids and solar heat transfer equipment.  
• Examples include:  
 – ANN models accurately predicting nanofluid viscosity and thermal conductivity with minimal error.  
 – Feedforward neural networks optimizing the performance of solar collectors and heaters, where the error in thermal efficiency predictions has been reduced to as low as 2%.

[Section 7: Application of AI in Mass Transfer]

• Mass transfer is fundamental to unit operations such as absorption, distillation, and extraction.  
• Similar to heat transfer, challenges arise from non-linear behavior and limited experimental data.  
• AI techniques (ANN, LSTM, DNN, and RF) have been successfully applied to:  
 – Predict mass transfer coefficients with high accuracy (errors reduced from 20–30% with traditional methods down to around 5% using ANN).  
 – Calculate concentration distributions and simulate dynamic mass transfer processes by building comprehensive databases from both experiments and CFD simulations.  
• These models have demonstrated faster computation and improved reliability, paving the way for real-time process optimization in chemical engineering operations.

[Conclusions and Future Perspectives]

• The reviewed paper provides a comprehensive survey on the integration of AI with CFD, highlighting advancements across aerodynamics, turbulence, specific flows, heat transfer, and mass transfer.  
• Hybrid and data-driven models have significantly reduced computation time while maintaining—or even enhancing—prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.  
• Future research should focus on:  
 – Deepening the integration between physical insights and AI algorithms to overcome the “black-box” nature of data-driven models.  
 – Expanding high-fidelity databases to further improve training for both steady and unsteady flow phenomena.  
 – Addressing overfitting and enhancing model generalization for complex industrial applications.  
• The combination of AI with conventional CFD promises to open new avenues for designing efficient and robust systems in aerospace, chemical processing, and energy conversion.
